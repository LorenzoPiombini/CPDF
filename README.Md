# cpdf - Lightweight PDF Text Extractor in C

`cpdf` is a lightweight C library for extracting text from PDF files. It parses PDF structure, decompresses streams, decodes embedded fonts with CMaps, and extracts readable text—even from PDFs using embedded or subset fonts (like those generated by ExpertPDF, Acrobat, etc.).

This is not **FINAL**! It is currently in development and has so far only been tested and developed using ExpertPdf Producer.

## 🚀 Features

- Parse raw PDF structure and cross-reference table
- Handle stream decompression using `zlib` (`/FlateDecode`)
- Decode Type0 fonts using embedded `/ToUnicode` CMaps
- Extract text even when BT/ET blocks are not used (rendered text via form XObjects or CMAP-encoded streams)
- Handles CID fonts and mapping character codes to Unicode
- Works offline, fully written in portable C
- Keep track of unkown unicode

## 🛠 Dependencies

- `zlib` (for stream decompression)
- Standard C library

> 🧪 Tested on Linux (GCC)
