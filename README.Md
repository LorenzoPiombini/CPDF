# cpdf - Lightweight PDF Text Extractor in C

`cpdf` is a lightweight C library for extracting text from PDF files. It parses PDF structure, decompresses streams, decodes embedded fonts with CMaps, and extracts readable textâ€”even from PDFs using embedded or subset fonts (like those generated by ExpertPDF, Acrobat, etc.).

This is a low-level implementation intended for developers who want full control over PDF internals or want to integrate raw PDF parsing into custom applications.

## ğŸš€ Features

- Parse raw PDF structure and cross-reference table
- Handle stream decompression using `zlib` (`/FlateDecode`)
- Decode Type0 fonts using embedded `/ToUnicode` CMaps
- Extract text even when BT/ET blocks are not used (rendered text via form XObjects or CMAP-encoded streams)
- Handles CID fonts and mapping character codes to Unicode
- Works offline, fully written in portable C
- Keep track of unkown unicode

## ğŸ›  Dependencies

- `zlib` (for stream decompression)
- Standard C library

> ğŸ§ª Tested on Linux (GCC)

## ğŸ“¦ Building

```bash
gcc -o cpdf main.c cpdf.c -Iinclude -lz
```

## Make sure zlib is installed:

```bash
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
```
